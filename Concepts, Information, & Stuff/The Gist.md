# Rundown
## Welcome...
...to **`Ocean Afar`**, a modpack centered around a long term extraction where you and a crew of people work to explore, colonize, and extrapolate resources from an ocean planet.
## Introduction
You are part of a sect of units owned by a company by the name of **`SYNDICTIVE COLONIZATION COMPANY`**. You and your fellow crewmates are labeled with the name of **`D.Y.V.`** (Disposable Yet Valuable) units.  Your task as a unit is to colonize a planet and get it ready for human infrastructure and civilization, all while extracting resources invaluable to the company.

You and your fellow **`D.Y.V.`** units are introduced to the planet of **`Profanis 38`**, a world defined by its ocean riddled surface, its rich and alien fauna, and its surplus of resources under the earth below the waters. 

You are tasked to colonize this planet as you would any other planet. You are given a decently sized rig complete with a sub-surface lift and plenty of storage accomodations to fit the resources you will be gathering.

You and your fellow units are also given additional tasks, most of them being persistent material quotas requiring you to process bulk amounts of common materials, and others being along the lines of daily quotas meant for more specific materials.
